## About me

I’m Mark Silvis. I recently graduated college with a degree in computer science. I live in Pittsburgh with my girlfriend and two cats. My interests include programming language theory, application development, coffee, tennis, craft beer, organization, reading, philosophy, and traveling.

I began programming in college, beginning with a Python-based introductory course my freshman year. I was a neuroscience major, a wannabe doctor, hoping to sharpen my analytic skills. The preliminary courses weren’t going to provide the depth in neurophysiology I craved. I thought computers may be systemically similar to the brain so, earnest and naïve, I jumped in to learning about computer science.

My initial reaction to programming was eagerness, followed by rancor, ending with captivation when the reality of it settled. I could make computers *do* things. Whatever I wanted. Needless to say, my interest in computer science overtook my initial ambitions. I dove in, and now here I am blogging about programming.

### Why I Want To Blog

I find a lot of value in reading the opinions of others. There are many influential programmers such as [Jeff Atwood](codinghorror.com), [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html), and [Steve Klabnik](http://www.steveklabnik.com), who share their thoughts on many topics of their interests. These people are leaders in the industries in which they work, and I suspect writing has helped them develop the communication skills necessary to be effective at what they do and achieving their goals.

I don’t think starting this blog is going to make me influential or necessarily interesting. If I’m lucky, I’ll get good at this and help someone or change a view. Mostly, I’m doing this for me, to articulate my thoughts cogently. Maybe I’ll make a signal in all the noise.

### Focus Of This Blog

Programming as it is a large part of my life, will be the core of this blog, archiving my evolution as a programmer, shaping my opinions, proving myself a hypocrite, and sharing knowledge*. Sometimes I’ll post about personal or philosophical topics unrelated to programming.
